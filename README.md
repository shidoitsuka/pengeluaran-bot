### About
Have you ever thinking to "note" your money usage(s) so you can take a look at the note and then easily calculate and find out what did you just bought this month.
If you do, or if you did that on a "notepad" (nope. Not that app.) and you use discord often, there's a simple way so you can easily have an "online" notepad XP.

### What's this bot all about?
- Just noting your money stuff(s).
- Oh you can also make sure that this bot is online by typing ping. lol.
> I mean, it's useful! >:v

Side note
> I could say that this is totally a private bot, but since I think people might have the same problem as me, I decided to publish it to GitHub.
